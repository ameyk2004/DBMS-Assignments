## Introduction


### What is Database

A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed.

Database handlers create a database in such a way that only one set of software program provides access of data to all the users.

There are many databases available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, MongoDB, Informix, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.

Modern databases are managed by the database management system (DBMS).


### Cloud database
Cloud database facilitates you to store, manage, and retrieve their structured, unstructured data via a cloud platform. This data is accessible over the Internet. Cloud databases are also called a database as service (DBaaS) because they are offered as a managed service.

Some best cloud options are:

AWS (Amazon Web Services)
Snowflake Computing
Oracle Database Cloud Services

### NoSQL Database
A NoSQL database is an approach to design such databases that can accommodate a wide variety of data models. NoSQL stands for "not only SQL." It is an alternative to traditional relational databases in which data is placed in tables, and data schema is perfectly designed before the database is built.


### What is DBMS?
- Database Management System (DBMS) is software for storing and retrieving usersâ€™ data while considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs that manipulate the database. 

- The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software store and retrieve data.
